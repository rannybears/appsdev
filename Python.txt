Python Programming Language
-created by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991,
-Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with iuts notable use of significant whitespace ( decimal to binary )
-versatile language used to various fields from web development to data science, embedded sysmtems and artificial intelligence.
-simplicity, readability, and easy to learn

Basic Structure of a Python Program
-Import Statements: To include external Python modules.
-Functions and Classes: Building blocks of Python code.
-Statements and Expressions: Executable instructions.
-Comments: For adding descriptions and explanations within the code.

Import Statements in Python
-Import statements in python allow for using modules and packages, which are collections of functions and classes.
Example:
import math
from datetime import datetime
# Other imports...

Syntax Rules in Python
-Python syntax is designed for readability:

	-Indentation: Python uses whitespace indentation to define code blocks.
	-Variables and Assignment: Python doesn't require explicit variable declaration.
	-Dynamic Typing: Variables types are determined at runtime

	EXAMPLE :

	x = 10 # Variable Assignment
	if x > 5:
		print("x is greater than 5")

Errors in Python

Pythons error can be categorized into:

-Syntax Error: Mistakes in the structure of a statement or expression.
-Runtime Errors: Errors detected during execution (often exceptions).
-Logical Errors: Errors in the logic of the program.

Comments in Python

- Single-Line Comments: Start with #
- Multi-Line Comments: Starts with (""")

Variables in Python

-Start with a Letter or Underscore: Variable names should begin with a letter (A-Z/a-z) or an underscore (_)
-Include Alphanumeric Characters and Underscores: They can include letters, numbers, and underscores.
-Avoid Python Keywords: Avoid using Python keywords (like if, else, while, etc.) as variable names.
-Case Sensitivity: Python variable names are case-sensitive.

Example:

username = "admin"
item_count = 50
_price = 19.99

Data Types in Python

-Basic Types: int, float, str, bool.
-Collections: list, tuples, dict, set.

Constants in Python

-Constants are not enforced by Python syntax, but by convention, they are written in uppercase:

Example:

PI = 3.14159
MAX_SIZE = 100
